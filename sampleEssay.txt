Particles with the same electric charge sign repel each other. So additional interactions are required to hold protons close-packed in the nucleus. These interactions arise from quark and antiquark pairs called pions that constantly spill out of each proton and neutron to be absorbed by another such particle nearby. The energy exchanged in this transfer is big enough to compensate for the electric repulsion between protons and, thus, bind together protons and neutrons, storing the immense energy that may be released in nuclear fission processes.
